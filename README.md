 Hi, I’m Satyam Rai — a passionate supply chain professional, entrepreneur, and lifelong learner.

🌱 My journey began in India, where I earned my Bachelor’s in Business Administration and gained over three years of experience managing logistics and operations as Assistant Manager at India's No.-1 Logistics and Supply Chain company.
Alongside, I run my own business, navigating the dynamic world of trade and supply with an entrepreneurial spirit.

🎓 Currently, I’m pursuing a master’s degree in Supply Chain and Logistics at Leeds Beckett University, blending my business experience with advanced analytical and tech skills.

💻 I’m also an aspiring tech enthusiast, diving into coding and building projects that solve real-world problems and improve efficiency. I enjoy exploring new technologies and crafting innovative solutions.

🌍 I believe in continuous growth, meaningful connections, and the power of combining business insight with technology to create smarter, sustainable futures.

✨ Outside work and studies, I’m passionate about learning, connecting with curious minds, and turning challenges into opportunities.

Let’s connect, collaborate, and build something great!
